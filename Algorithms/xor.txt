XOR AND OTHER BIT PROPERTIES
------------------

1.  xor with same number is 0
2.  xor of a particular number for even number of times is 0
3.  xor of a particular number for odd number of times is that number itself
4.  a^b^c^a = a^a^b^c
5.  xor sum is the successive xor operations on integer 
    let say we have numbers from 1 to n as 1 2 3 4 5 6
    then the xor sum of the numbers is 1^2^3^4^5^6
6. in order to find whether is bit is set or not in a number :
    find AND of that each bit of that number with 1<<i
    for(int i=0;i<=32;i++){
        if(arr[0] & 1<<i)
            set

        else
           not set
    }
